                    <p class="para">Have you heard of JavaScript, the programming language of the web? JavaScript is a
                        great first programming language because it's easy to learn, powerful, and is everywhere around
                        us.</p>
                    <p class="para">JavaScript powers the websites you visit every day, and it’s used by professional
                        engineers at groundbreaking companies like YouTube, Facebook, and yes, even here at Tynker! When
                        you write code with JavaScript, you can easily share it with friends and run it in any web
                        browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).</p>
                    <p class="para">As with all programming languages, the best way to learn JavaScript is to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn the basic syntax — the rules that all programs must follow</li>
                        <li>Take a beginner’s course to see what’s possible</li>
                        <li>Choose practical projects that inspire you and complete them on your own!</li>
                        <li>Find a community of learners at your school or online so that you can share your knowledge
                            and excitement about coding.</li>
                        <li>Try additional tutorials and take more courses.</li>
                        <li>Add new capabilities to JavaScript using libraries like p5.js or node.js. Dig into related
                            technologies like HTML and CSS. Or try out another language like Python or Java and start
                            the process all over again!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="heading">How to Stay Informed About JavaScript Updates</h2>
                    <p class="para">The best way to remain informed about JavaScript updates is to keep up with the
                        latest online JavaScript news and its use in web development. It also helps to follow JavaScript
                        developers online that have experience in the industry on a daily basis. Another way to remain
                        in the loop is to attend events or seminars that discuss changes in the software development
                        industry.</p>
                    <p class="para"> If you want to learn, following blogs and forums can help. These blogs discuss tips
                        and tricks to help you learn faster or solve problems with this powerful language. Some even
                        contain practical examples that explain the guidance provided. We will discuss these blogs and
                        their blog post content later in the article.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading">JavaScript Rules The Web</h3>
                    <p class="para">JavaScript rules the web because of its popularity. The programming language is used
                        to create the client-side of the website. To write any interaction on mobile applications, web
                        apps, or sites, you need to use JavaScript. While it is not the only programming language that
                        professionals can use, it is better than most for front end development.</p>

                    <h4 class="heading">JavaScript Retired jQuery</h4>
                    <p class="para">Different websites still load the jQuery library with ease. However, many do not
                        need to anymore because of JavaScript. This programming language supports everything and
                        performs better than jQuery in many ways.</p>

                    <h5 class="heading">JavaScript Offers an Excellent API </h5>
                    <p class="para">JavaScript also offers an excellent API for the web. It has many functions, from
                        notifications to DOM manipulation, camera functionality, battery preservation, telephony, web
                        sockets, Bluetooth, and SMS.</p>

                    <h6 class="heading">JavaScript Support</h6>
                    <p class="para">There are several resources to get JavaScript support, such as forums and other
                        channels like social media, books, and websites. The most popular one is developer.mozilla.org.
                    </p>

                    <p class="para"><strong>Please note:</strong> You cannot learn to program by just reading. You have
                        to actively write and experiment with the code. If you find errors, don't worry, this is the
                        best way to learn—by making mistakes and trying again. Whatever you do, make sure you're writing
                        code and trying out the examples in your courses and books!</p>
